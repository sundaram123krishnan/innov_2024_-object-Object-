But science has begun to paint a stunning picture of how the future might unfold.

Let's take a journey to the end of time.

12
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:38,620
We will travel through time exponentially, doubling our speed every 5 seconds.

13
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:44,634
The vision of the future will surely evolve
as we probe for more clues. But one thing is clear:

14
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:46,536
The universe has only just begun.

"Cold, dark, and empty - this is how the cosmos will spend most of its life."

196

"Our universe gives life only a brief moment to shine - a haven in time, safe from its fiery birth and icy death."

00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:53,987
A galaxy will basically be

a supermassive black hole in the center,

They'll eat each other, and they'll get bigger,

it's just that the time scales we're talking about

"Some grow to enormous sizes, possibly trillions of times the mass of our sun."

235
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:55,475
"When they merge, they send out powerful gravity waves that resonate throughout the universe."

236
00:14:56,243 --> 00:15:01,500
Black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum.

237
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:11,501
And have a very characteristic song,

238

Imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together

239
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,505
At the end of their lives they're going around each other,

240

crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second.

241
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,202
As they do so,

242
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:36,522
they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space

243
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:38,762
an actual wave on space-time.

244
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:56,496
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out

245
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:59,006
from these black holes banging on the universe.

246
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:04,918
Those are the gravitational waves

247
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:07,518
and are literally the sounds of space ringing

248
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:09,478
and they will travel out from these black holes

249
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:13,758
at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce into one,

with the squeezing and stretching of space,

254
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,743
you would literally hear the sound.

255

Imagine a lighter black hole

256
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:43,114
falling into a very heavy black hole.

The sound you're hearing

258
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:46,984
is a light black hole banging

259
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:49,584
on space each time it gets close.

260

As it falls in, it gets faster, and it gets louder.

00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,489
We call it 'Dark energy'.

00:21:29,718 --> 00:21:32,194
Dark energy, unlike matter or radiation,

340
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:35,214
does not dilute away, as the universe expands.

341
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,724
This has crucial implications

349
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:15,738
resides in empty space and we don't understand why.

350
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:19,751
But we do know what will happen.

351
00:22:21,254 --> 00:22:23,754
If that energy continues to be there,

352
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:27,244
the universe will become cold and dark and empty.

353
00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:32,021
That's the future as it might be.

354
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:34,496
We don't know because

355
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:37,246
we don't yet understand the nature of dark energy.

356
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:37,967
until we do,

357
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:39,517
we won't know the future,

358
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:41,737
we won't even understand our own origins

359
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,247
and that's why we want to know

360
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:45,237
and study this subject.

361
00:22:47,096 --> 00:22:54,226
"Discovering the true nature of dark energy could change our vision of the future dramatically."

362
00:22:55,889 --> 00:23:02,899
"If it somehow weakens over time, the universe could collapse under gravity - a 'big crunch'."

363
00:23:04,098 --> 00:23:10,228
"Given a boost, it could tear the universe apart at the seams - a 'big rip'."

364
00:23:12,487 --> 00:23:22,017
[Black hole era]
"Physicists increasingly suspect that there may be multiple universes beyond our own, each with their own unique laws of physics."

365
00:23:25,074 --> 00:23:33,744
"Some would harbor the right conditions for life. Others could collapse or be ripped apart."

366
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:41,592
"Others sill could be far more exotic than anything we could imagine."

367
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:51,875
"New pieces to this puzzle are out there somewhere, waiting to be found."

368
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:54,474
The forecast does seem to be for

369
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:58,274
an ever-colder, ever-emptier universe.

370
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,720
But then of course we have to ask,

371
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,000
"Could that end lead to a new beginning?"

372
00:24:10,488 --> 00:24:13,488
And there are ideas, whereby what actually is the end

373
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:15,328
of our universe, could in some sense,

374
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,488
lead to the beginning of a new one.

375
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:29,628
"Some speculate that there may be a way to escape our universe before entropy erases everything."

376
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:38,054
"We could create simulated virtual universes, or with enough energy, create another one just like our own."

377
00:24:43,507 --> 00:24:44,967
We've worked out the mathematics,

378
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:45,747
the equations,

379
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:46,739
they seem to say that

380
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:48,759
if you have an atom smasher,

381
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,749
that can constrict tremendous

382
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:52,994
amounts of energy at a single point,

383
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:55,514
you can perhaps open up a gateway -

384
00:24:55,514 --> 00:24:56,574
A 'Baby universe'

385
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,250
Facing the death of everything there is

386
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,970
this perhaps is their only possibility of escape.

387
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:15,007
And this also raises a very intriguing possibility,

388
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:16,777
sheer pure speculation of course,

389
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:20,767
that perhaps any universe that has intelligent life in it,

390
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:23,742
will create baby universes, will create 'Lifeboats',

391
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:25,940
and will proliferate child universes.

392
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,600
and will proliferate child universes.
[Last Black Hole evaporates]

393
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,742
[Last Black Hole evaporates]

394
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:33,502
So an evolution may take place among universes,
[Last Black Hole evaporates]

395
00:25:33,502 --> 00:25:34,502
in the multiverse.
[Last Black Hole evaporates]

396
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:38,732
Survival of the fittest may take place.

397
00:25:38,732 --> 00:25:42,252
So those universes which do not have intelligent life are 'Infertile',

398
00:25:42,252 --> 00:25:43,472
they have no children.

399
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,392
But those universes that have

400
00:25:45,392 --> 00:25:47,772
mild temperatures, stars like ours,

401
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:50,982
would create civilizations that could open up child universes

402
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:54,242
and they would then proliferate.

403
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:05,819
"If there is no way to escape the universe, then entropy will march on, destroying the last remaining supermassive black holes."

404
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:13,319
"As the last one explodes and dies, it bathes the universe in light one last time."

405
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,789
[Black Hole era]
"As the last one explodes and dies, it bathes the universe in light one last time."

406
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:16,629
[Last Black Hole evaporates]
"As the last one explodes and dies, it bathes the universe in light one last time."

407
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:11,523
THE END.

408
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,746
After an unimaginable length of time,

409
00:27:27,831 --> 00:27:30,966
even the black holes will have evaporated,

410
00:27:31,036 --> 00:27:32,762
and the universe will be

411
00:27:32,832 --> 00:27:35,976
nothing but a sea of photons

412
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:38,996
gradually tending towards the same temperature

413
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:41,878
as the expansion of the universe cools them

414
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:43,488
towards absolute zero.

415
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:59,249
Once the very last remnants

416
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:01,239
of the very last stars

417
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:04,239
have finally decayed away to nothing,

418
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:07,169
and everything reaches the same temperature,

419
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:11,495
the story of the universe finally comes to an end.
