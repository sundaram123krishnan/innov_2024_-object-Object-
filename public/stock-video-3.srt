1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,759
What we're looking for is how everything works

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What makes everything work

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,760
It has to do with curiosity.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,000
It has to do with people wondering

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
what makes something do something?

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,980
There's a way of looking anew

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,840
As if you never saw it before the first time and asking questions about it as if you were different

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,900
And then to discover that if you try to get answers then that we made it return

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The things that make the wind, make the waves.

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,900
The motion of water, is like the motion of air,

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,800
is like the motion of sand

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,800
Things have common features

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,300
It turns out more and more universal

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's almost unbelievable

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,500
The truth is so remarkable, so amazing

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,360
It's incredible

17
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,780
Take the world from another point of view

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,700
It's curiosity

19
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,700
It's the way who we are, what we are

20
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,920
Just like a runner gets a kick out of sweating

21
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,580
I get a kick out of thinking

22
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
I can't stop

23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
It's curiosity
