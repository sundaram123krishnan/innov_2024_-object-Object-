because it's relentless.

When a star around 15 times

the mass of our Sun collapses,

all the matter in it's core is crushed

49
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:49,504
into an infinite void of blackness,

00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,249
know as Stellar Mass Black Hole.

51
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,830
The immense gravitational pull of

52
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,740
these monsters can rip a star apart.

53
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,950
They tear matter from its surface,

This super-heated matter spins

and great jets of radiation fire from the core.

58
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,300
Although these jets can be seen across the cosmos,

59
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,759
the core itself remains a mystery.

60
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:52,775
Not even light can escape,

61
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:56,300

there's a constantly battle

66

between energy pushing out and gravity pushing in.

67
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:11,654
When it runs out of fuel,

68
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:13,134
the star collapses

69
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:14,644
and then explodes with

00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:17,744
the brightness of a billion of suns.

00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,904
As the star is torn apart,

00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:41,190
it will fire out into space
